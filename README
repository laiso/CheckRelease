How To Use:
    python check_release.py <root_path> [<exclude_class_list_filename>]
    
        root_path: root directory of the source codes to find .m, .mm, .h files recursively.
        exclude_class_list_filename: filename of "Don't Check This Class" list. In the file, Write ONE Class name in ONE Line.

Specification:
    This program find that retained or copied properties those seem not to be released in Objective-C.
    The result will output to stdout.
    You should remember that it is NOT perfect. (^^;
    
    It supposed that:

    * "Property declaration" is written in @interface - @end block.

    * Property declaration may be written in .h, .m, .mm files.

    * "Release description" is written in @implemantation - @end block of .m or .mm files.
    
    * Property declaration is 'ONE property is in ONE line', like:
        
        @property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber *userId;
        @property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber *score;
        
        NOT
        
        @property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber *userId, *score;
    
    
    * Syntax of release description of 'myName' property is like:
        
        self.myName = nil;
        
        or
        
        [myName release] or [_myName release] or [myName_ release]    (autorelease is also OK)
        
        or
        
        [self setMyName:nil];
    
    * The place of release description is not checked whether it will be executed when dealloc is called.
